// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

usernames = ['devil', 'ava', 'john', 'admin', 'chris', 'maria'];

for (username of usernames) {
    if(username == "admin"){
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    } else {
        console.log("Hello " + username + ", thank you for logging in again");

    }
}
